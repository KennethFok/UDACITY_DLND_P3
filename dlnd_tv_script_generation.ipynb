    "## Build the Neural Network\n",
    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",

    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",
    "2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "To generate the text, the network needs to start with a single word and repeat its predictions until it reaches a set length. You'll be using the `generate` function to do this. It takes a word id to start with, `prime_id`, and generates a set length of text, `predict_len`. Also note that it uses topk sampling to introduce some randomness in choosing the most likely next word, given an output set of word scores!"
